A Basic kernel module named my_xtime, created to acquire current kernel time and elapsed kernel time
since the last proc file read. Uses current_kernel_time() and stores the return value of that function.

When my_xtime is loaded (using insmod), it will create a proc entry called /proc/timed. 
When my_xtime is unloaded (using rmmod), /proc/timed is removed.


To run: Run make to acquire the .ko files
	insert the my_xtime module using insmod
	use cat /proc/timed to get current time
	further reads using "cat /proc/timed" will display not only current time but also elapsed time since last read
	remove the my_xtime module using rmmod
